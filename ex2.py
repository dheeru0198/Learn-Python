# In computer programming, a comment is a programming language construct used to embed programmer-readable annotations in the source code of a computer program.

#Comments are usually added with the purpose of making the source code easier to understand.

# In Python the comments are placed after '#'.

# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "This is my second exercise in python" # from the book "Learn Python the hard way.

# Comments can be used to hide code from the interpreter for testing.

# print "Hidden code"

print "This is visible to interpreter"
